As an Azure Functions developer, it is important to follow best practices and avoid common pitfalls that can cause problems in your applications. In this article, we will discuss some things that you should never do when developing Azure Functions, in order to ensure that your functions are reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.

Don't use global variables: Azure Functions are designed to be stateless, meaning that each function execution is independent and does not retain any state from previous executions. Using global variables can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to understand the logic of your functions. Instead, use input and output bindings to pass data between function executions.
```cs
// Bad
public static int Counter = 0;

[FunctionName("MyFunction")]
public static void Run(
    [QueueTrigger("myqueue")] string message,
    ILogger log)
{
    Counter++;
    log.LogInformation($"Counter: {Counter}");
}
```
```cs
// Good
[FunctionName("MyFunction")]
public static void Run(
    [QueueTrigger("myqueue")] string message,
    [Table("mytable")] out TableEntity entity,
    ILogger log)
{
    entity = new TableEntity
    {
        PartitionKey = "partition1",
        RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
        Counter = 1
    };
}
```

Don't use blocking calls: Azure Functions are designed to be highly scalable and should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests. If your functions make blocking calls, such as waiting for a response from a slow API or reading from a file, it can slow down the overall performance of your application and prevent other requests from being processed. Use asynchronous programming patterns to avoid blocking calls and ensure that your functions can handle a high volume of requests.
```cs
// Bad
[FunctionName("MyFunction")]
public static void Run(
    [QueueTrigger("myqueue")] string message,
    ILogger log)
{
    // This call blocks the function execution until the response is received
    var response = HttpClient.GetStringAsync("https://slowapi.com/api/endpoint").Result;
    log.LogInformation(response);
}
```
```cs
// Good 
[FunctionName("MyFunction")]
public static async Task Run(
    [QueueTrigger("myqueue")] string message,
    ILogger log)
{
    // This call does not block the function execution and allows the function to handle other requests concurrently
    var response = await HttpClient.GetStringAsync("https://slowapi.com/api/endpoint");
    log.LogInformation(response);
}

```
Don't hardcode sensitive information: It is a security best practice to avoid hardcoding sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, in your code. Instead, use Azure Key Vault or other secrets management solutions to securely store and retrieve sensitive information at runtime.

Don't use large dependencies: Azure Functions are designed to be lightweight and efficient, so it is generally not a good idea to include large dependencies in your functions. This can increase the size of your deployment package and slow down the execution of your functions. Instead, consider using smaller libraries or writing custom code to achieve the same functionality.

Timeouts:  It's important to keep in mind the potential for timeout issues caused by large, long-running functions. To avoid these issues, consider breaking up your functions into smaller, more focused sets that can work together and return responses quickly. This is especially important for webhooks and HTTP trigger functions, which often require an immediate response.

One way to achieve this is by using storage queues for cross-function communication. These queues are a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution for passing messages between functions. It's worth noting, however, that individual messages in a storage queue are limited to 64 KB in size. If you need to pass larger messages, you may want to consider using an Azure Service Bus queue or Event Hub.

Another option to consider is using Durable Functions or Azure Logic Apps to manage state transitions and communication between multiple functions. This can be particularly useful if you need to coordinate the execution of multiple functions or need to maintain state across function invocations.

Ultimately, the key to avoiding timeout issues is to keep your functions focused and efficient, and to carefully consider the best approach for managing communication and coordination between them.

By following these best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, you can ensure that your Azure Functions are reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.
