I am Dan Volovyk, a programmer with a passion for technology and a love for experimentation. I received my Master's degree from the Faculty of Intelligent Decision Making Systems, and have since become an expert in .NET and Microsoft Dynamics 365. I am also a professional in Azure, and have obtained several certificates from Microsoft to further enhance my skills and knowledge in the field.

Throughout my career, I have always been drawn to working with new technologies and finding creative solutions to complex problems. I am a true innovator, always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible with software development.

As a result of my dedication and expertise, I have become a respected member of the tech community, and am often sought after by companies looking to leverage my skills and insights. Whether I am working on a new project or collaborating with colleagues, I approach each day with enthusiasm and a drive to learn and grow.
